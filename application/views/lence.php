                    A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses or disperses a light beam by means of
                    refrection. A simple lens consists of a single piece of transparent meterial, while a compound
                    lens consists of several simle lenses, usually arrange along a common axis.Lenses are made from
                    materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polish or moulded to a desired shape.
                    A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refrects light without focusing.
                    Devices that similary focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also
                    called lenses, such as microwavelenses,electron lenses,acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.<br>
                    We have generally the following lenses in our optical center. The lenses are usually
                    prescribed by the Optomatrist.   There could be more but there are important..

                        Depending on requirment, plano convex or double convex be prescribed.

                        focused correctly at the same time. Depending on requirment plano cylindrical or total
                        cylindrical lenses may be prescribed.
                        It also possible that peaple are given bifocal lenses with two lensescombined in one spectale.
